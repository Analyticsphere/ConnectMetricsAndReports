# ConnectMetricsAndReports

Run the Import Code first, and then you can run the codes for the daily & weekly reports. In the import code, make sure to change the file name in the code to match the name of the file that is being imported (this will likely just be a date change if you keep the same naming convention for the data file). Make sure to save the summary stat macro to your local file, and change all file locations in the import code, daily metrics code, and weekly report code to your local file path.
